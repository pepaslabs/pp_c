# pp_c

Some single-file C libraries

## pp_tree

A trivial binary tree.

## header-libs.txt

This repository also contains a `header-libs.txt` file.

This is a line-oriented file where each "library" is represented by three lines:
- A package name
- A package version
- A URL from which to download the single-file C library file

For example, a `header-libs.txt` with two versions of `foo` and one version of `bar` might look like:

```
foo
0.1
http://example.com/libs/foo/0.1/foo.h
foo
0.2
http://example.com/libs/foo/0.2/foo.h
bar
0.1
http://example.com/libs/bar/0.1/bar.h
```
